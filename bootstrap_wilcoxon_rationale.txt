BOOTSTRAP & WILCOXON RATIONALE
==========================================================================================
Primary inference strategy updated:
- Use adjusted ANCOVA/logistic models with robust standard errors as primary inference.
- Use propensity-weighted models for confounding-by-indication adjustment.
- Retain nonparametric testing only as sensitivity checks for key outcomes (HbA1c, LDL).
Rationale:
- Bootstrap/Wilcoxon are useful for robustness but computationally heavy and do not adjust confounding.
- Adjusted regression provides effect estimates with covariate control and interpretable CIs.
