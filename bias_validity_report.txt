BIAS & VALIDITY REPORT
==========================================================================================

A) Immortal Time Bias
- Assessment: Detected (combination-group IT>0 rate: 100.0%).
- Fix implemented: Landmark time-zero alignment at 90 days from first observed exposure.
- Impact: 105 of 252 patients changed exposure group after alignment.
- Diagnostics exported: /Users/jcbn/Desktop/CODEX/immortal_time_diagnostics.csv

B) Left Censoring / Triple Therapy Misclassification
- Assessment: evaluated observable lookback before first observed exposure.
- Triple-therapy reclassification at 365-day lookback: 100.0% potentially left-censored.
- Sensitivity implemented with alternative lookback windows: 90, 180, 365, 730 days.
- Diagnostics exported: /Users/jcbn/Desktop/CODEX/left_censoring_sensitivity.csv

C) HbA1c Frequency / Measurement Bias
- Assessment: median total HbA1c count varied by 2.5 across groups.
- Mitigation implemented: inverse-intensity weighting and restricted comparable-intensity analysis.
- Reported results include unweighted and mitigated estimates.
- Diagnostics exported: /Users/jcbn/Desktop/CODEX/hba1c_frequency_diagnostics.csv
- Mitigation results exported: /Users/jcbn/Desktop/CODEX/hba1c_frequency_mitigation_results.csv
